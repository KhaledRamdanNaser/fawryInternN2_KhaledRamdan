# Quantum Bookstore ðŸ“š | Fawry NÂ² Dev Slope #10 Challenge

This Java project was developed as part of the **Fawry NÂ² Internship Challenge (Dev Slope #10)** for Summer 2025.  
It simulates an **online bookstore system** with clean architecture, multiple book types, and full test case coverage.

## ðŸ’¼ Challenge Overview
The objective was to build a modular bookstore system that:
- Manages various types of books
- Supports adding, removing, and buying operations
- Interacts with external services (simulated) like shipping and mailing
- Is extensible and follows good software engineering principles

## âœ… Features Implemented

### ðŸ“˜ Book Types Supported
- **PaperBook**
  - Has stock quantity
  - Uses `ShippingService` to simulate delivery
- **EBook**
  - Has a file type
  - Uses `MailService` to simulate email sending
- **DemoBook**
  - Not for sale (throws an exception on purchase)

### ðŸ”„ Core Functionalities
- âœ… Add a book (ISBN, title, author, year, price)
- âœ… Buy a book using its ISBN, quantity, email, and address
  - Reduces stock (if PaperBook)
  - Triggers shipping/email via service interface
  - Throws error if not available or not allowed
- âœ… Remove outdated books (older than N years)
- âœ… Show full inventory with type and details
- âœ… Extensible design (new book types can be added without modifying existing code)

### ðŸ§ª Test Class: `QuantumBookstoreFullTest`
- Demonstrates all major use cases:
  - Valid PaperBook and EBook purchases
  - Attempting to buy a DemoBook
  - Out-of-stock handling
  - Buying non-existent ISBN
  - Removing old books and listing inventory
- Each scenario includes proper console output and clear simulation messages

> ðŸ§  **Note:** I used **ChatGPT** as an AI assistant **only to help generate the test cases**.  
> It helped by giving me:
> - Book names and ISBNs for realism
> - Edge-case examples (e.g., stock = 0, demo book)
> - The structure of the test method `QuantumBookstoreFullTest.java`

> ðŸ’¡ All core code logic, structure, and class implementation were written and understood entirely by me as part of the Fawry Internship Challenge.

## ðŸ§  OOP Concepts Used
- Inheritance (`Book` superclass with 3 types)
- Abstract methods (`buyBook`)
- Interface-based services (`ShippingService`, `MailService`)
- Dependency Injection (passing services into constructors)
- ArrayList to manage inventory
- Exception handling for business rules

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Java 8+
- No external libraries
- Pure console application (OOP focused)

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure
â”œâ”€â”€ Book.java # Abstract class for all books
â”œâ”€â”€ PaperBook.java # Paper book logic (stock + shipping)
â”œâ”€â”€ EBook.java # Ebook logic (file + mailing)
â”œâ”€â”€ DemoBook.java # Not-for-sale book
â”œâ”€â”€ BookInventory.java # Manages inventory (ArrayList)
â”œâ”€â”€ ShippingService.java # Interface
â”œâ”€â”€ HandleShippingService.java # Simulated implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ MailService.java # Interface
â”œâ”€â”€ HandleMailService.java # Simulated implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ QuantumBookstoreFullTest.java # Test class with all scenarios!
